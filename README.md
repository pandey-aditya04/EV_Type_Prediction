# EV Type Prediction Using Machine Learning 🚗🔋

This repository presents a supervised machine learning pipeline designed to predict the type of electric vehicle (EV) based on key numeric and categorical features. The pipeline leverages preprocessing techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and logistic regression classification.

## 🔍 Objective

To develop a robust and scalable machine learning model that can classify EV types by:
- Handling missing values effectively.
- Encoding categorical features using One-Hot Encoding.
- Scaling numerical features for optimal model convergence.
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
